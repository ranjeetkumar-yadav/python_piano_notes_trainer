# python_piano_notes_trainer
This is a simple python project to teach fresh piano students learn names of the keys. It uses python's Tkinter library.

It features 7 white keys, 5 black keys of piano.

The game starts when the user presses Start button
The user will be presented with piano key names and he/she has to click the corresponding piano key.
If the users guesses the correct key the socre is updated and score label turn green. 
If the user's guess is incorrect the score is updated and the socre label turns red.
The user can also restart the game by pressing the Restart button(It is the same button as Start Button). This will reset the score

This is a simple app and does not include option to persist the score.

Hope you like it!
